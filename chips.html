        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">2 large potatoes</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">Salt, to taste</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">Optional seasonings: paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-instructions">
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Scrub the potatoes clean under running water and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Using a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife, slice the potatoes thinly (about 1/16 inch thick).</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Place the potato slices in a bowl of cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes. This helps remove excess starch and makes the chips crispier.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">After soaking, drain the potato slices and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Fry the potato slices in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the fryer. Fry for about 3-4 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Remove the chips from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Season the chips with salt and any other desired seasonings while they are still hot.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Let the chips cool completely before serving. Store any leftovers in an airtight container.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Enjoy your crispy and flavorful homemade potato chips!</li>
        </ul>
