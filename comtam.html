        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-instructions">
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a round cake pan with butter or cooking spray.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. Heat over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Add the cooked sticky rice to the saucepan and stir until well combined. Let it cook for a few minutes until the rice absorbs the coconut milk mixture and becomes sticky.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Transfer the sticky rice mixture to the greased cake pan, pressing it down firmly to form an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until the top is slightly golden.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool slightly. Once cooled, unmold the cake onto a serving platter.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Top the cake with diced grilled pork belly, pickled vegetables, crushed peanuts, and crispy fried shallots.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Drizzle fish sauce caramel over the cake for a savory-sweet flavor contrast.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves before serving.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Slice and enjoy your unique and delicious Cơm Tấm Cake!</li>
