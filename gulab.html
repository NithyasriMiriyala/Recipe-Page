        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 cup milk powder</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">3-4 tbsp milk (approximately)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients for Sugar Syrup</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 cup sugar</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 cup water</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">4-5 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">A few strands of saffron (optional)</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 tsp rose water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-instructions">
            <li class="recipe-instruction">In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Add the melted ghee and mix well until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Gradually add milk, little by little, and knead the mixture into a soft dough. The dough should be smooth and slightly sticky.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Meanwhile, prepare the sugar syrup by combining sugar, water, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron in a saucepan.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-6 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the rose water. Keep the syrup warm.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Divide the dough into equal-sized portions and shape them into smooth balls without any cracks. Make sure the balls are compact and smooth, without any cracks.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan over medium-low heat. Once the ghee is hot, carefully add the dough balls in batches, without overcrowding the pan.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Fry the balls on low heat, stirring gently and occasionally, until they turn golden brown and evenly cooked from all sides. This may take about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Once fried, remove the balls from the ghee using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing them on paper towels.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Transfer the fried balls to the warm sugar syrup and let them soak for at least 1-2 hours, allowing them to absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Serve Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts or dried rose petals, if desired.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Enjoy the deliciousness of homemade Gulab Jamun!</li>
