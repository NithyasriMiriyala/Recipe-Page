        <h1 class="recipe-title">Mango Sticky Rice</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 cup glutinous rice (sticky rice)</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 ripe mango, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 cup coconut milk</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">Toasted sesame seeds or mung beans (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-instructions">
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Rinse the sticky rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Then, soak the rice in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Drain the soaked rice and steam it in a bamboo steamer or a steaming basket lined with cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel, for about 25-30 minutes until tender and cooked through.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">While the rice is steaming, prepare the coconut sauce. In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, granulated sugar, and salt. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Transfer the cooked sticky rice to a large bowl. Pour half of the coconut sauce over the rice and gently mix until the rice is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">To serve, place a portion of the sweetened sticky rice on a plate or in a bowl. Arrange slices of ripe mango on top or alongside the rice.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Drizzle the remaining coconut sauce over the mango and rice.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Optionally, garnish with toasted sesame seeds or mung beans for added texture and flavor.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Serve the mango sticky rice warm or at room temperature, and enjoy this delightful Thai dessert!</li>
        </ul>
