        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">6-8 medium-sized apples (such as Granny Smith or Braeburn)</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed if frozen</li>
            <li class="recipe-ingredient">Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="recipe-instructions">
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Peel the apples, cut them in half, and remove the cores.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">In a 9 or 10-inch oven-safe skillet or Tarte Tatin pan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Add the sugar to the melted butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted and turns golden brown to make a caramel sauce.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Arrange the apple halves, rounded side down, in the skillet on top of the caramel sauce, fitting them tightly together.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Cook the apples over medium heat for about 10-15 minutes until they are lightly caramelized and tender.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">While the apples are cooking, roll out the puff pastry dough on a lightly floured surface to fit the size of the skillet.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Carefully place the puff pastry over the cooked apples, tucking in any excess dough around the edges.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Bake the Tarte Tatin in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Remove the Tarte Tatin from the oven and let it cool in the skillet for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">To serve, place a serving plate over the skillet and carefully invert the Tarte Tatin onto the plate so that the caramelized apples are on top.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Serve the Tarte Tatin warm, optionally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream on the side.</li>
            <li class="recipe-instruction">Enjoy your delicious homemade Tarte Tatin!</li>
